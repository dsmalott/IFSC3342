    <h1 class="text-center">PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
    <p>We value the privacy of our community. Whether you are one of our artists, makers, visitors, and clients, the security and use of your personal information matters. Very few people actually read privacy statements because they are bogged down with legalese so we try to keep it simple and straight forward.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>We collect personal information in order to provide services and products to you at your request; for example, when you request a commission quote or buy a product.</li>
        <li>We use anonymized information to help us improve, develop, and analyze our website. We do this by using Google Analytics. To learn more about Google&apos;s privacy practices, click the following link: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en">Privacy Policy &mdash; Privacy & Terms &mdash; Google.</a></li>
        <li>We use cookies to manage our website and provide targeted advertising, but you have choices about this:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Managing cookies: If you prefer not to accept cookies, most browsers will allow you to manage cookies in your browser settings to disable or block cookies, remove existing cookies, automatically accept cookies or to notify you when you receive a cookie. Options available may vary by browser. However, if you disable, modify, or reject cookies, some parts or functionalities of our website may be inaccessible or not function properly. For example, disabling cookies may require you to repeatedly enter information to take advantage of services or promotions.</li>
                <li>Opting out of online personalized advertising and do not track: We or our marketing and advertising service providers may use information about your activities on our sites or other websites, to help tailor our advertisements or offers to what may interest you — this is often called interest-based advertising. To limit interest-based advertising <a href="https://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1#!%2F">click here</a>. You may continue to see generic or non-targeted ads about our products and services if you opt-out of interest-based advertising. Although we do our best to honor your privacy preferences, we are currently not able to respond to “Do Not Track” signals from your browser.</li>
            </ul>
        <li>We may send you email marketing communications about products, features and services that might interest you. You can opt out from receiving by clicking the unsubscribe link located at the bottom of each communication. If you opt out from receiving marketing emails, we may still send you non-marketing emails such as emails about your products or services, responses to your requests and inquiries, or notices of updates to our terms of use.</li>
        <li>Our websites may include Social Media features, such as the Facebook Like button and widgets, such as the Share This button or interactive mini-programs that run on our site. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our website, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.</li>
        <li>Protecting your personal information is important to us. We use a combination of reasonable technical, administrative, and physical safeguards to protect your personal information. However, no website, mobile application, database, or system is completely secure or “hacker proof.” So, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. You are also responsible for taking reasonable steps to protect your personal information against unauthorized disclosure or misuse. We limit access to your personal information to those who need it to do their jobs.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To keep the lawyers happy:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Personal information may be disclosed to third parties, as required by law or subpoena, or if we reasonably believe such action is necessary to:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>comply with the law and the reasonable requests of regulators, law enforcement or other public authorities</li>
            <li>protect our or others safety, rights, or property, and investigate fraud or to protect the security or integrity of our Sites or any product or services.</li>
            </ul>
        <li>We may periodically update or revise this Privacy Statement. The effective date at the top of the document shows when this Privacy Statement was last revised. We will let you know when we update the Privacy Statement by changing the date.</li>
